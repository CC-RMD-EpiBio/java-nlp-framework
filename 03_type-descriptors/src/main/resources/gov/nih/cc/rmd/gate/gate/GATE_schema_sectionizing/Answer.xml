  <!-- XSchema definition for Answer
       An answer is part of the structure that includes a question, a delimiter like a question mark, and an answer.
       Question Answers differ from a slot value construct in an obvious way.  When the delimiter is a question mark, its
       a question answer rather than a slot value.  Also, when the answer is a sentence or a paragraph, it's a question 
       and answer.
