  <!-- XSchema definition for SlotValue
       A slot value is a semi-structured format that includes a slot (contentHeading), an optional delimiter,
       and an optional small value.  
       A small value is something like a number, a word, a term, a single phrase.  
       A small value should not be a full sentence. If you see a full sentence complete with a period at the end, 
       this is more like a section zone with a section name.
       
       
      these are now covered by sub labels that should overlap
