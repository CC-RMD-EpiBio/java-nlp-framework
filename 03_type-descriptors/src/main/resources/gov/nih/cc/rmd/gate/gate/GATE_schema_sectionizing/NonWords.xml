  <!-- XSchema definition for a NonWords
  NonWords is a catch all class for sequences of non word characters, as what happens when there
  are ocr errors and items like horizontal rules.  While I don't think that a machine annotator
  will mark these, it might be instructive to mark these to ignore manually.
