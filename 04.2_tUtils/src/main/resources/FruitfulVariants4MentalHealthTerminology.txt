FruitfulVariants4MentalHealthTerminology
========================================

This tool creates fruitful variants for Mental Functioning Terminology.  Fruitful variants 
are the spelling variants, inflections, derivations, synonyms, acronyms and acronym expansion
and a combination of these in a mix that was empirically tuned.
 
  This is a component of the MetaMap system, and This is outlined in the paper Effect of Textual 
Variation on Concept Based Information Retrieval. Proceedings of the AMIA Symposium, 373-377, 1996.
(See https://lexsrv3.nlm.nih.gov/LexSysGroup/Projects/lvg/2014/docs/userDoc/references/96_AMIA_TextualVariation.pdf)
 
 
An example of one of these starts with the term ocular, which has a derivation of oculus, the
synonyms eyepiece and and eye.  Getting synonyms of synonyms yields optic, and taking the
derivation of which yields vision. And so it goes.  Each step incurs a transformation 
which, when logged from the beginning term to the final variant labeled in the history field. 
The more the transformations, the less related to the initial term the variant is. There is 
a formula to compute a cost from the history.

Fruitful variants is a flow component of the Lexical Variant Generation (LVG) tool. This tool 
pulls the the term from the ontology file (it's in the third field). 
(see https://lexsrv3.nlm.nih.gov/LexSysGroup/Projects/lvg/2014/docs/designDoc/UDF/flow/fG.html)   

The output is in the UMLS LRAGR format plus additional information behond the obligitory fields.

The output is in the following format: 

     
[TermID|variant|pos|infl|Concept Name|Ontology Seed|Category|Sources|SourceIdentifiers|OntologyId|History|cost]
   
Where the 
| Option Name         | Description |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| Concept Name        | is the concept found via traversing through the UMLS hierarchy 
                        from the point of the concept taken from the ontology, otherwise 
                        referred to as the ontology seed. |
|Ontology Seed        | is The entity from the ontology this term is derived from |
|Category             | is the top level category taken from the ontology.  |
|Sources              | are the UMLS Sources the concept Name came from if it exists | 
|Source identifiers   | are the UMLS Concept Identifiers (cui's) that are associated with this concept name |
|Ontology ID          | is the id of the seed term from the ontology. 
|History              | is the log of the transformations from ontology seed to this variant concept name |
|Cost                 | is a numeric calculation derived from the history. | 

Additional Filtering
--------------------

 | Filter               | LVG's flow component | Notes |
 | -------------------- | -------------------- | ----- |
 |  syntatic uninversion |  (-f:S)   | (see https://lexsrv3.nlm.nih.gov/LexSysGroup/Projects/lvg/2014/docs/designDoc/UDF/flow/fS.html)  |
 |  remove Nec and NOS     -f:0     (see https://lexsrv3.nlm.nih.gov/LexSysGroup/Projects/lvg/2014/docs/designDoc/UDF/flow/f0.html )  |
 |  remove parenthetical expressions | | like (Finding) and [D]  | 

Additional Variants generated 
-----------------------------
 | Variant Type  | Notes |
 | ------------- | ----- |
 | Generate "of" inversions |  | For two word terms. That is, for two words _A_  _B_, generates _A of B_, _A of the b_, _A of a B_, _A of her B_, _A_of his B_ 
 | Permuted Variants | For two word terms.  It runs all the fruitful variants for each term, permutes them, and filters out those permuted terms which do not appear in the SPECIALIST Lexicon |

More Details 
------------
The history and cost are useful evidence indicating how much "drift" has occurred from the seed term to the variant.  The details of the meanings of the history are

 | Operation | Notation | Distance | score |
 | --------- | -------- | -------- | ----- |
 | No Operations|n|0 |
 | Spelling Variant|s|0 |
 | Inflectional Variant|i|1 |
 | Uninflectional Variant|b|1 |
 | Synonym|y|2|
 | Acronym/Abbreviation|A|2|
 | Expansion|a|2|
 | Derivational Variant|d|3|
 | of inversions|Of|3|
 | Permuted Variants |  | concatintation of each |sum of them |

   

Usage:

Another Detail:
---------------
   This program requires that the path to a current installed version of LVG is in the classpath. 
    The program looks for a $LVG/data/config/lvg.properties file which has references to all
    the lvg resource files the tool needs.
