ExpanedFormsFromLvg 

This tool creates ....


The output is in the UMLS lragr format plus additional information. 

The output is in the following format: 

     
TermID|variant|pos|infl|Concept Name|ontology Seed|category|Sources|SourceIdentifiers|OntologyId|History|cost|
   
Where the concept Name is the concept found via traversing through the UMLS hierarchy 
from the point of the concept taken from the ontology, otherwise referred to as the ontology seed.
The category is the top level category taken from the ontology.  The sources and source identifiers 
are the UMLS sources and concept identifiers (cuis) of the concept name. The ontology ID is the 
id of the seed term from the ontology.  History and cost are explained above. 

Some filtering that is being hooked in includes
                         LVG's flow component
   syntatic uninversion  (-f:S)
   remove Nec and NOS     -f:0
   
For two word terms, generate "of" inversions and "of the" inversions
For two word terms, generate permuted terms

Another Detail:
   This program requires that the path to a current installed version of LVG is in the classpath. 
    The program looks for a $LVG/data/config/lvg.properties file which has references to all
    the lvg resource files the tool needs.
