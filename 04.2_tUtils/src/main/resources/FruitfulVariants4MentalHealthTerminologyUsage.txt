FruitfulVariants4MentalHealthTerminology

This tool creates fruitful variants for Mental Functioning Terminology.  Fruitful variants 
are the spelling variants, inflections, derivations, synonyms, acronyms and acronym expansion
and a combination of these in a mix that was empirically tuned.   This is a component of the 
MetaMap system, and This is outlined in the paper Effect of Textual Variation on Concept 
Based Information Retrieval. Proceedings of the AMIA Symposium, 373-377, 1996.  
An example of one of these starts with the term ocular, which has a derivation of oculus, the
synonyms eyepiece and and eye.  Getting synonyms of synonyms yields optic, and taking the
derivation of which yields vision. And so it goes.  Each step incurs a transformation 
which, when logged from the beginning term to the final variant labeled in the history field. 
The more the transformations, the less related to the initial term the variant is. There is 
a formula to compute a cost from the history.

Fruitful variants is a flow component of the Lexical Variant Generation (LVG) tool. This tool 
pulls the the term from the ontology file (it's in the third field). 

The output is in the UMLS lragr format plus additional information. 

The output is in the following format: 

     
TermID|variant|pos|infl|Concept Name|ontology Seed|category|Sources|SourceIdentifiers|OntologyId|History|cost|
   
Where the concept Name is the concept found via traversing through the UMLS hierarchy 
from the point of the concept taken from the ontology, otherwise referred to as the ontology seed.
The category is the top level category taken from the ontology.  The sources and source identifiers 
are the UMLS sources and concept identifiers (cuis) of the concept name. The ontology ID is the 
id of the seed term from the ontology.  History and cost are explained above. 

Some filtering that is being hooked in includes
                         LVG's flow component
   syntatic uninversion  (-f:S)
   remove Nec and NOS     -f:0
   
For two word terms, generate "of" inversions and "of the" inversions
For two word terms, generate permuted terms

Another Detail:
   This program requires that the path to a current installed version of LVG is in the classpath. 
    The program looks for a $LVG/data/config/lvg.properties file which has references to all
    the lvg resource files the tool needs.
