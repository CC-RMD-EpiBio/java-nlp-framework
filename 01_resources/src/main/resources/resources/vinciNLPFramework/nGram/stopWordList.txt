# Stop word list for nGrams.  This list should
# include the usual suspects, and also be guided
# by the top of the ngram list.  Any word that
# returns more than a quarter of the corpus is
# not likely to be useful.
#
# Created Oct. 27, 2011
# Modified March 2, 2012 - added written numbers, as well.
# Modified March 3, 2012 - removed the single words from stopword list
#                          turns out they are needed for lookup
