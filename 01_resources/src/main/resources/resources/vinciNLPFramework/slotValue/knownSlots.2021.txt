# 
#   This is a file containing
#   slot names from slot:value pairs.
#   The slot names in this file are
#   those that do not fit the normal
#   pattern, and would otherwise be missed.
#
#   The format for this file is
#     name|[SLOT|HEADING|SECTION|FALSE]|[PROCESS|DONT_PROCESS]
#         
#     where names labeled with SLOT are really slot names
#                              HEADING are not slot names but content heading names.
#                              FALSE are names that should not be slot or heading names.
#     Where the field PROCESS indicates further NLP processing
#                     should take place on the content.
#                     and DONT_PROCESS indicates the content for
#                     this slot is quantitative value or sensitive
#                     data, and should be ignored by other processes.

#                              This should be further refined.  There are
#                              headings that are both slots and section
